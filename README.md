Es9ini is an app designed specifically for Tunisian farmers. To get started, you create an account, log in, and upload pictures of your plants. 

Es9ini analyzes these images and categorizes the plants using our first model.

Then, based on weather data (like precipitation), soil conditions, humidity, plant age, and other factors, our second model predicts the ideal time to water. This prevents water waste due to evaporation or unnecessary watering before expected rain.

The app is connected to a device that automatically manages irrigation, and the farmer is notified when watering is scheduled or completed.
